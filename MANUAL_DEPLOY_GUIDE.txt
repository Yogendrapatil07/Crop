TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "Drag and drop not working"
Solution: Use OPTION 2 (CLI) instead

Problem: "Build folder too large"
Solution: The .next folder should work fine. If not, contact me.

Problem: "Site shows errors after deploy"
Solution: Next.js apps need special configuration on Netlify.
          We need to use Netlify CLI or GitHub for proper deployment.
